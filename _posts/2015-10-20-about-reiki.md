## What is Reiki?

Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. Sessions last 30-60 minutes during which you will be seated comfortably in a chair or laying on a massage table, gentle music playing in the background, while I place my hands in various positions on your head, shoulders, back, knees, calves, and feet.

## What Reiki is not

Reiki is not massage. We will not be kneading your muscles, nor will you be required to undress (though you are encouraged to remove your shoes if you are comfortable doing so).
