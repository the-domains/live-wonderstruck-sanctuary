Welcome to 31 Days of Nest Building wherein I will share my tales of getting acquainted with my home and making it my own. And yes, the spiders are being evicted.

For the month of October I am participating in the[31 days][0] challenge to write about one topic for, you guessed it, 31 days. Given my new life chapter in a new space in a new town, what better topic to choose than home?

Moving is more than the already giant feat of purging, packing, hauling, and unpacking. Moving is a lesson in self. It shows you how you live. It highlights what makes you comfortable and what doesn't. It stretches your self-imposed limits (hello, home repairs).

We are still getting acquainted, this space and I. We are learning each other's behavior, quirks, lovable traits, as well as "opportunities for improvement." Where does the light fall in the morning, afternoon, and at sunset? Where does air get in and out? How many spiders moved in while this place stood vacant? (Answer: A LOT!)

This week marks one month in my new home, though it isn't a \*new\* home, just new-to-me.

Follow the rest of the story here -- [31 Days of Nest Building][1].
